# Research-Causes-of-Deaths-World-Wide
Research's the top leading causes of death world wide. 
The question that was researched was, What is the disease that caused the most amount of deaths from a specific time range. The time range that the data was taken was from 1990-2019. The question that was chosen seemed interesting as I wanted to know which disease had caused the most deaths through the 29 years that were recorded and how dangerous some diseases truly are. I also wanted to see how many people were truly affected by these diseases and health conditions.
The data that was used to answer this question was from Keggle posted by Madhar Pant. The data contained 31 diseases and health conditions, listed below them was the amount of deaths caused by those diseases for each year through the 29 years. The data also included every country across the globe and how many citizens were affected by these diseases and health conditions. Some countries were affected by some disease compared to other countries.
